          Stone Soup Review <br>
          by Claire Hungerford

          <br><br>
Sunday November 13 <br>
I tasted the soup around this time on Thursday, so three days ago. I got the invitation from
Ainsley on my desk a couple days before that–it was a small, smooth rock with a note wrapped
around, secured by a string that was either green, maybe yellow. I forgot to visit the website that
was on the invitation, and I was already somewhat familiar with the tradition of stone soup. I
heard the site had a list of ingredients people would contribute to the stone soup, so, for the
record, I was never exposed to that list.<br><br>
My memory of the soup: I knew it had a large Japanese sweet potato (since that was what I
contributed). I also knew about the lentils that Lester brought (since we drove there together). I
remember yellow potatoes, and there were yams. Celery, onion, carrots, definitely garlic. I think I
remember some dark greens, and chickpeas even. I’m sure if I was writing this yesterday or the
day before I would be able to recall more ingredients. My most distinct memory that persists
though, and the thing I want to talk about, because it made a big impression on my rating, was
the dark umber hue and the thick, cloudiness of the broth. It was very nourishing, and I
remember being surprised that the soup had reached this level of complexity in such a short
amount of time.<br><br>
It wasn’t that I had my doubts about the soup: I knew it would be good, but I also knew that this
wasn’t about the quality of the soup, so I didn’t have expectations. But the quality of the soup
deserves some documentation or discussion. It was such good soup. And in the way that
certain soups are known to improve over time in the fridge, as my memory of the ingredients
fades, certain layers of the soup rise to the foreground, congealed. That layer that is most
upfront in my memory now that I’m writing is the coming-togetherness of the soup, the way it
was so cohesive, and its color. And so the final ingredient I recall, one that I know was there
because I remember passing behind MC as she was whisking it on the stovetop, was the roux.
I don’t mean to undermine the magic of the stone soup–the story, the resourcefulness, the kind
of communal materialization of something from nothing. But I think the roux was a kind of glue
that thrusted this into being. I’m not sure, but I imagine it was the last ingredient, added towards
the end, magically thickening in a somewhat dramatic fashion a large volume of soup, almost
like a kind of visitation. Any roux requires a flour and a fat, combined at 1:1, and thickened over
heat–in the case of this one, I think it was probably butter and some sort of fatty stock. I’m
thinking the roux was less an ingredient of the stone soup, as it was the structure of the soup
itself, similar in constitution to the soup pot or the flame.<br>
The stone, the key ingredient, was never actually there. Everything was added to complement
the myth of the stone. The soup, like a spontaneous, food-based reconstruction of Waiting for
Godot, is a series of conversations and encounters amongst people and ingredients made
valuable only in the context of the absence of the main character, or the stone. I rate the soup
11/10: the extra point was the roux, which was the ghost of the original stone that night, I think.
