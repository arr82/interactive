Hi Michaela,
<p> Happy Valentine's day! I wanted to ask you if you'd be willing to be interviewed for me as part
of a school project. I've been asked to interview someone that I  adore on the internet but haven't
met in real life and I thought of you! If you're willing to answer some questions I can email
them to you tonight :) </p>
<p>Aww, that's so sweet!
I am honored and would love to help. I adore you too, my internet friend "love cute angel emoji"
</p>
<p>
Amazing thank you !!! </p>
<p>Thank you for being willing to participate in this little interview! The aim of this interview is to get to know you a
little better primarily through the books in your life. </p>
<p>For any of the questions feel free to respond with images words or both wherever you see fit. But first I'd like to know...
</p>
<p>
Let's start by getting a picture of your workspace. What do you see when you look at your desk right now?
</p>
<p>
What do you see when you look out your window?
</p>
<p>
and what do you see when you look up?
