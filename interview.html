A: Hi Michaela,
<p> Happy Valentine's day! I wanted to ask you if you'd be willing to be interviewed for me as part
of a school project. I've been asked to interview someone that I  adore on the internet but haven't
met in real life and I thought of you! If you're willing to answer some questions I can email
them to you tonight :) </p>
<p> <span style="color:olive">
M: Aww, that's so sweet!
I am honored and would love to help. I adore you too, my internet friend
</span>
</p>
<p>
A: Amazing thank you! The aim of this interview is to get to know you a
little better primarily through the books in your life. </p>
<p>For any of the questions feel free to respond with images words or both wherever you see fit. But first I'd like to know...
  Let's start by getting a picture of your workspace.
</p>
  <p>
    What do you see when you look at your desk right now?
</p>

<p> <span style="color:olive">
M: When I look at my desk I see: a green cutting mat with paint and ink splotches, a plant that's doing well, a glass of water 3/4 full, some paper mache flowers I made, cluttered art supplies, and an Ipad.
</span>
</p>

<p>
A: What do you see when you look out your window?
</p>

<p> <span style="color:olive">
M:Outside my window, I see: the roof of a garage and the kitchen windows of the apartments next door. The sun is shining and it's catching the rainbow prisms in my window. I see chimneys and the tops of evergreen trees.
</span>
</p>

<p>
A: and what do you see when you look up?
<p>

  <p> <span style="color:olive">
  M:When I look up, I see my slanted studio ceiling. There's a wood beam painted pink with a string of paper mache moons and stars hanging from it.
