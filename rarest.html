    <p> A:What is the most rare book you own in your personal library?
</p>

<p> <span style="color:olive">
  M:I don't know that I have many rare books but I do have a really magical book called Un Deux with pictures by Yoshie Watanabe and words by Naomi Takayama. I got it at the bookstore years ago. It's in Japanese and it was wrapped in cellophane and I didn't even know what was inside but I could tell it was special. When I got it home and finally opened the book, it was everything I ever wanted..and more!

  A:What book in your library have you owned for the longest amount of time?
</p>

<p> <span style="color:olive">
  M:The book I've had for the longest amount of time is a little golden book called the Tawny Scrawny Lion. My mom wrote an inscription inside, with my name and the year, 1988. It was a present from my first christmas.
