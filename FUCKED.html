<p> A: Something I love about your work is the magic and warmth it holds. There is a familiarity in it that reminds me of childhood and makes me want to sit down and draw for pure enjoyment. I wonder if there was a specific childrenâ€™s book that you loved and read over and over again as a Child?
</p>
<p>
If there are multiple, was there one that you loved particularly for the imagery?
Do you think any of the books you read as a kid influence your work now?</p>
<p> <span style="color:olive">
M: Thank you so much! Some of the books I remember reading over and over are:<p>

</p></span>

<p><span style="color:olive">
All of these books had great imagery and stories.The three little wolves had memorable imagery like a house made out of flowers.<br>

The books I read as a kid definitely influence the work I make now. How...maybe in too many ways to name! I like to make art in a space of wonder, imaginations, and play. Picture books really helped me develop those senses and skills.
